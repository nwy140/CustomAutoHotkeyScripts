(Screenplay) of A Weird Day
// Director states the camera angle and scene setting
// Observer observes the character's actions in the film


// Director: We're looking down at a pit from the top with Mius, an injured teenager...
// Observer: Mius tries to shake off a visible injury than may have been caused by a fall. With visible minor scars on his face
// Director: Camera switch to a close up shot in front of Mius looking from a lower angle

Mius: Arg!!  (Heavy Breathing)...
+ Gotta Get Up
    // Observer: Mius gets up in a weak manner, unable to get up properly, he tries to push himself back up until he does so
    Mius: Where am I again???  (Visible confused)
    Mius: Sigh... I'll find a way out of here... (Looks up)
    Director: Camera Rotates up and shows a bright light at the very top of the pit. A Disiney's Weenie that leads Mius out
    Input ready... Gameplay ready...
    Director: Screen fades to black and then unfades, and camera goes back to mius
    
    Mius: Now, how do I get out of here... (Jumps)
    Observer:  Mius jumps really high and then falls back on the ground... with his butt flat on the ground
    Mius: Ouch... When was I this flexible, it doesn't make sense?  (Visibly surprised)
-> DONE
